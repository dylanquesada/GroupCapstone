# Shvlr

Shvlr is a gig-economy app using ASP.NET MVC 5 built with Entity framework using code-first. The application is integrated with the Twilio API to send text notifications to homeowner subscribers when snow is expected. Weather forecast information is tailor-made for each homeowner location using a combination of the Google Maps API and the DarkSky API. This forecast determines whether or not a <i>snowtification</i> will be sent the day before expected snow.
